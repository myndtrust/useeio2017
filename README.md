# useeio2017
Python in Jupyter Notebook implementation of USEEIO2017

The data set is provided in a zip file, once you down unzip and store the xlxs file in the head directory.

The module uses pickle version of the xlxs spread to speed things up alot. 

Several cells have conditional statements that must be set at the intial run, but they should be changed in subsequent runs; these mostly create/store files.

There are a couple interactive cells also. THe input vector can be manually input interactively or the 'activity', DataFrame can be modified and used inline. Its recoomended that all input vectors be saved in a csv format for later access.
